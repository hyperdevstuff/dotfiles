# stages to build nvim config

- [x] Vim Options (default options that set common stuff)
- [x] Key Mappings ( this will incrementally change according to plugins used and configured)
- [x] Plugin Manager ( Got the lazy up and running)
- [x] Git signs and Git integrations ( I have done this half and the other complicated part is remaining although its necessary to have good git integrations I just gonna avoid that for now)
- [x] Lsp configurations ( This was tedious task for sure but did it somehow decently)
- [x] Auto Complete (blink.cmp)
- [ ] Ai Stuff (there is no need of this for now.)
- [x] Markdown and note-taking (holy grail of note-taking in nvim with obsidian doesn't exist there are alot of limitations and caveats)
- [ ] Debugger
- [x] Lazy Loading for better startup time.

## TODO

- read about Ex-colors plugin for efficient color_scheme.
- read bunch of docs/manuals to get good with the nvim because KNOW YOUR TOOLS.

# UPDATE

Might slowly move to [LazyVim] or [NvChad]. Reasons:

- Easy to maintain and config with nicer defaults.
- Less breaking stuff and less reading docs/readme for core utils or mush-have plugins.
- Still there will be decent amount of control required but its still better than weird behaviour.
